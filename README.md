## Who Is This For?

This website is for anyone looking to learn, or re-learn algorithm and data structures.

There are a ton of websites and applications for this, but none had the explanations and implementations grouped together.

## Why I Made This

I made this to give condensed information to anyone studying computer science... but I also made this to better learn and understand algorithms & data structures myself because this is a difficult topic!

I hope you gain value from reading/skimming through the site and please feel free to message me or send in pull requests!

## Big O (Algorithm Analysis)

_Big O_ Notation is a way for computer scientists and programmers to _rank_ differing
algorithms based on how much time an algorithm will take to execute and how much space in memory it will take up.

Except, since every machine has different processing speeds and connection strength, we can't simply put a time and space
in common integers. Instead, Big O is a way to give the algorithm in question a position on the hierarchy when the inputs are increased to very large numbers.

This approach takes the larger view and often the worst case because computers are very quick so there are only
minute differences between all algorithms with an input of 3 bits. But send in an array of _ten million_ strings and you are going to want an efficient way to perform your function.
