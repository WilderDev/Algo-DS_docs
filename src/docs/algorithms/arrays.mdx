## The Basics

An **array** at it's simplests is a collection of arranged data. Each item inside of an array is stored with adjoining memory locations.

The benefits of arrays comes from the fact that each piece is indexed and easily referenced.

## Easy Problems

### Q1: Count Unique Elements

Given a sorted array, return the number of unique integers from an input array consisting of integers greater than 0 and less than infinity.

```js title=scripts/unique-val-calc lineNumbers=true
function uniqueValCalc(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 0) return 0;
  let prev;
  let count = 0;

  arr.forEach((val) => {
    if (val !== prev) count++;
    prev = val;
  });

  return count;
}
```

##### Time Complexity: O(n)

##### Space Complexity: O(1)

### Q2: Max Sub Array

Given an array of integers and a range as an integer n, find the subarray of length n with the greatest sum and return the sum.

```js title=scripts/max-sub-array lineNumbers=true
const maxSubArr = (arr, num) => {
  if (arr.length < num) return null;

  let maxSum = 0;
  let tempSum = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < num; i++) {
    maxSum += arr[i];
  }

  tempSum = maxSum;

  for (let i = num; i < arr.length; i++) {
    tempSum = tempSum - arr[i - num] + arr[i];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, tempSum);
  }

  return maxSum;
};
```

We solved this problem using the **Sliding Window** method.

## Intermediate Problems

### Q3: Array Rotation

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

```js title=scripts/array-rotation lineNumbers=true
const rotate = (nums, k) => {
  const s = k % nums.length;
  const rest = nums.splice(nums.length - s, s);

  nums.splice(0, 0, ...rest);
};
```

##### Time Complexity: O(n)

##### Space Complexity: O(1)
