## The Basics

An **array** at it's simplests is a collection of arranged data. Each item inside of an array is stored with adjoining memory locations.

The benefits of arrays comes from the fact that each piece is indexed and easily referenced.

## Easy Problems

### Q1: Count Unique Elements

Given a sorted array, return the number of unique integers from an input array consisting of integers greater than 0 and less than infinity.

```js
function uniqueValCalc(arr) {
  if (arr.length === 0) return 0;
  let prev;
  let count = 0;

  arr.forEach((val) => {
    if (val !== prev) count++;
    prev = val;
  });

  return count;
}
```

##### Space Complexity: O(1)

## Intermediate Problems

### Q3: Array Rotation

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

```js
const rotate = (nums, k) => {
  const s = k % nums.length;
  const rest = nums.splice(nums.length - s, s);

  nums.splice(0, 0, ...rest);
};
```
