## The Basics

We often use computational power to do complex
or tedious math quickly and accurately.

_Computers + math = best friends_: because of this relationship, there are tons of efficient algorithms
relating to math that we will explore here!

## Easy Problems

### Q1: Sum of All Elements

Output the total sum of all the numbers in an array. 1 <= n >= 2^30

```js
// !!! READABLE SOLUTION !!!
function addUpTo(maxNum) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= maxNum; i++) {
    total += i;
  }
  return total;
}

// !!! OPTIMAL SOLUTION !!!
const addConseq = (n) => (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
```

##### Time Complexity: O(1)

##### Space Complexity: O(1)

---

### Q2: FizzBuzz

Output numbers as strings from 1 to x. If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with “Fizz”.
If it is divisible by 5, replace it with “Buzz”. If it is divisible by 3 and 5 replace it with “FizzBuzz”.

```js
const fizzBuzz = (n) => {
  const answer = [];

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i % 5 === 0 && i % 3 === 0) {
      answer.push("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      answer.push("Buzz");
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      answer.push("Fizz");
    } else {
      answer.push(i.toString());
    }
  }

  return answer;
};
```

##### Time Complexity: O(n)

##### Space Complexity: O(n)

---

### Q3: Factorial

Using recursion, write a function that takes in a num and returns that `num!` (num factorial).

```js
const factorial = (num) => {
  if (num === 1) return 1;
  return (num = num * factorial(num - 1));
};
```

##### Time Complexity: O(n)

##### Space Complexity: O(n)

## Intermediate Problems

### Q3: Sudoku

Given a Sudoku board partially filled out, return true if that board is valid. You do not need to check if the game is solvable! Check if what is currently on the board is indeed valid!

Your input will look like:

```
isValidSudoku([
 ["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]])
```

and this board should return `true`

```js
function isValidSudoku(board) {
  let r = new Array(9);
  let c = new Array(9);
  let b = new Array(9);

  for (let i = 0; i < r.length; i++) {
    r[i] = {};
    c[i] = {};
    b[i] = {};
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < 9; j++) {
      if (board[i][j] == ".") continue;

      let boxIndex = Math.floor(i / 3) * 3 + Math.floor(j / 3);

      let v = board[i][j];
      if (r[i][v]) return false;
      r[i][v] = true;

      if (c[j][v]) return false;
      c[j][v] = true;

      if (b[boxIndex][v]) return false;
      b[boxIndex][v] = true;
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```
