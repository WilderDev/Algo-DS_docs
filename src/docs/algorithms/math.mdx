## The Basics

We often use computational power to do complex
or tedious math quickly and accurately.

_Computers + math = best friends_: because of this relationship, there are tons of efficient algorithms
relating to math that we will explore here!

## Easy Problems

### Q2: Sum of All Elements

Output the total sum of all the numbers in an array. 1 <= n >= 2^30

```js
// !!! READABLE SOLUTION !!!
function addUpTo(maxNum) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= maxNum; i++) {
    total += i;
  }
  return total;
}

// !!! OPTIMAL SOLUTION !!!
const addConseq = (n) => (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
```

##### Time Complexity: O()

##### Space Complexity: O()

### Q1: FizzBuzz

Output numbers as strings from 1 to x. If the number is divisible by 3, replace it with “Fizz”.
If it is divisible by 5, replace it with “Buzz”. If it is divisible by 3 and 5 replace it with “FizzBuzz”.

```js
const fizzBuzz = (n) => {
  const answer = [];

  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    if (i % 5 === 0 && i % 3 === 0) {
      answer.push("FizzBuzz");
    } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
      answer.push("Buzz");
    } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
      answer.push("Fizz");
    } else {
      answer.push(i.toString());
    }
  }

  return answer;
};
```

##### Time Complexity: O(n)

##### Space Complexity: O(n)
