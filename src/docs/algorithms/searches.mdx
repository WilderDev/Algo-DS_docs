## The Basics

Searching Algorithms are designed to get a specific target element from a data structure.

As programmers, we use these to retrieve results from a database,
create effective GPS/vehicle routing software, and to get specific values from arrays.

## Types & Use Cases

There are a few different ways to search for data in programming. Here are two of the most common & effective ways.

**Sequential Search**: All elements of a list are checked consecutively. _eg: Linear Search_

**Interval Search**: Divide and conquer a list of sorted data for a more efficient algorithm. _eg: Binary Search_

There are also Hash, Jump, Interpolation, Exponential, and a few more searches designed for specific use cases.

## Sequential Searches

### Linear Search

Write a function that takes in an array and a target num. Return the index in the given array where the target number is located (else -1).

```js title=scripts/some-search lineNumbers=true
function linearSearch(arr, num) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === num) return i;
  }
  return -1;
}
```

##### Time Complexity: O(n)

## Interval Searches

### Binary Search

Write a function that takes in an array and a target num. Return the index in the given array where the target number is located (else -1).

```js title=scripts/some-search lineNumbers=true
function binarySearch(arr, num) {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
    let curr = arr[mid];

    if (curr === num) return mid;

    if (curr < num) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else if (curr > num) {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  return -1;
}
```

##### Time Complexity: O(log n)
