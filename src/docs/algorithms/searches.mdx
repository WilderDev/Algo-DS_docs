## The Basics

<!-- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/searching-algorithms/ -->

Searching Algorithms are designed to get a specific target element from a data structure.

As programmers, we use these to retrieve results from a database,
create effective GPS/vehicle routing software, and to get specific values from arrays.

## Types & Use Cases

There are a few different ways to search for data in programming. Here are two of the most common & effective ways.

**Sequential Search**: All elements of a list are checked consecutively. _eg: Linear Search_

**Interval Search**: Divide and conquer a list of sorted data for a more efficient algorithm. _eg: Binary Search_

There are also Hash, Jump, Interpolation, Exponential, and a few more searches designed for specific use cases.
