## The Basics

A sorting algorithm is a way to create an ordered array (usually) based on comparing the elements and rearranging their positions.

Javascript has a number of built in methods such as `indexOf()`, `find()`, `findIndex()`, and `includes()` to iteratively loop over an array...
but for more complex arrays, there are a plethora of options, each with their specific use cases/advantages.

## Types & Use Cases

There are many different ways to sort data in programming. Here are SOME of the most common & effective ways.

**Bubble Sort**: good for low dataset arrays that are almost already sorted.

**Selection Sort**: use rarely on small datasets when you need low space complexity

**Insertion Sort**: works with low dataset of almost sorted arrays with continually running (online) data.

**Merge Sort**: divide and conquer algorithm used with linked lists or when the data structure doesn't allow random access.

**Quick Sort**: divide and conquer algorithm used in most situations.

**Radix Sort**: Non-comparison sort used for arrays of integers (and binary). Extremely efficient in certain use cases.

## Common Sorts

### Bubble Sort

Loops over array and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

```js title=scripts/bubble-sort lineNumbers=true highlight={1}
function bubbleSort(arr) {
  // Helper function to swap two elements by index
  const swap = (arr, idx1, idx2) => {
    [arr[idx1], arr[idx2]] = [arr[idx2], arr[idx1]];
  };

  let shouldNotSwap;

  // For every iteration reset shouldNotSwap to be false;
  for (let i = arr.length; i > 0; i--) {
    let shouldNotSwap = true;

    // loop through and check if the curr idx is greater than next idx
    for (let j = 0; j < i - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        swap(arr, j, j + 1);
        shouldNotSwap = false;
      }
    }
    // If we didn't swap, go to the the next iteration of "i"
    if (shouldNotSwap) break;
  }

  return arr;
}
```

##### Time Complexity: O(n^2)

##### Space Complexity: O(1)

### Selection Sort

Loops to find the minimum element and moves it to start of the array.

```js title=scripts/selection-sort lineNumbers=true highlight={1}
function selectionSort(arr) {
  // Helper function to swap two elements by index
  const swap = (arr, idx1, idx2) => {
    [arr[idx1], arr[idx2]] = [arr[idx2], arr[idx1]];
  };

  // Loop through the array setting the minimum to be the array at the current idx every cycle
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let min = i;

    // Loop through and check if the next idx is lower than min (curr idx) and swaps if it is
    for (let j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (arr[j] < arr[min]) {
        min = j;
      }
    }
    if (i !== min) swap(arr, i, min);
  }

  return arr;
}
```

##### Time Complexity: O(n^2)

##### Space Complexity: O(1)

---

### Insertion Sort

Loops an array and picks an element from the unsorted section and places it in the (virtual) sorted array.

```js title=scripts/insertion-sort lineNumbers=true highlight={1}
some code here

```

##### Time Complexity: O(n^2)

##### Space Complexity: O(1)

---

## Advanced Sorts

### Merge Sort

Divides the array into halves, calls itelf on each half respectively using a base case, and finally, merges the results.

```js title=scripts/merge-sort lineNumbers=true highlight={1}
some code here

```

##### Time Complexity: O(n log n)

##### Space Complexity: O(n)

---

### Quick Sort

Picks a "pivot" element to divide the array into smaller parts to be placed back into a sorted array.

```js title=scripts/quick-sort lineNumbers=true highlight={1}
some code here

```

##### Time Complexity: O(n log n / n^2)

##### Space Complexity: O(log n)

---

### Radix Sort

Places elements into buckets depending on the digit value at a certain decimal place.

```js title=scripts/radix-sort lineNumbers=true highlight={1}
some code here

```

##### Time Complexity: O(nk)

##### Space Complexity: O(n + k)
