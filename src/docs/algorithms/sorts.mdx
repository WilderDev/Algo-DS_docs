## The Basics

A sorting algorithm is a way to create an ordered array (usually) based on comparing the elements and rearranging their positions.

For unsorted arrays, an iterative loop is usually the way to go. Javascript has a number of built in methods such as `indexOf()`, `find()`, `findIndex`, and `includes`...
but for sorted arrays, there are a plethora of options, each with their specific use cases/advantages.

## Types & Use Cases

There are many different ways to sort data in programming. Here are SOME of the most common & effective ways.

**Bubble Sort**: good for low dataset arrays that are almost already sorted.

**Selection Sort**: use rarely on small datasets when you need low space complexity

**Insertion Sort**: works with low dataset almost sorted arrays with continually running (online) data.

**Merge Sort**: divide and conquer algorithm

**Quick Sort**: divide and conquer algorithm

**Radix Sort**: Non-comparison sort used for arrays of integers (and binary). Extremely efficient in certain use cases.

## Common Sorts

### Bubble Sort

Loops over array and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

---

#### Insertion Sort

**Best**: O(n)

**Avg**: O(n^2)

**Worst**: O(n^2)

**Space**: O(1)

---

#### Merge Sort

**Best**: O(n log n)

**Avg**: O(n log n)

**Worst**: O(n log n)

**Space**: O(n)

---

#### Quick Sort

**Best**: O(n log n)
