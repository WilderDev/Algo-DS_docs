## The Basics

A string is an array of characters. In Javascript, a string is one of the main data types built in.

Most languages have many string methods you can use, but there are more complicated algorithms that
require manipulatating strings further, and that is what we will be exploring here.

## Intermediate Problems

### Q1: First Unique Character

Write a function that takes in a string and outputs the index of the first unique character in that string.

```js
const findFirstUniqueChar = str => {
  const uniqueChars = {};

  for (let char of str) {
    unique[char] = unique[char] + 1 : 1
  };

  const firstNonR = Object.keys(unique).find(key => unique[key] === 1);
  return firstNonR ? str.indexOf(firstNonR) : -1
}

```
