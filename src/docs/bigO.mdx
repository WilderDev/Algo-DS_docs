## What is Big O?

_Big O_ Notation is a way for computer scientists and programmers to _rank_ differing
algorithms based on how much time an algorithm will take to execute and how much space in memory it will take up.

Except, since every machine has different processing speeds and connection strength, we can't simply put a time and space
in common integers. Instead, Big O is a way to give the algorithm in question a position on the hierarchy when the inputs are increased to very large numbers.

This approach takes the larger view and often the worst case because computers are very quick so there are only
minute differences between all algorithms with an input of 3 bits. But send in an array of _ten million_ strings and you are going to want an efficient way to perform your function.

## The Basics

There are 8 (primary) grades for an algorithm. We will go from the fastest to the absolute slowest. It should go without saying,
but always aim to implement a more efficient solution when possible. The classifications are as follows:

1. **O(1)** - _constant_
2. **O(log n)** - _logarithmic_
3. **O(n)** - _linear_
4. **O(n log n)** - _loglinear_
5. **O(n^2)** - _quadratic_
6. **O(n^c)** - _polynomial_
7. **O(c^n)** - _exponential_
8. **O(n!)** - _factorial_
