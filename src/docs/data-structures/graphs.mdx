## The Basics

A graph is a collection of nodes and the connection between those nodes.
There is no specific pattern between nodes that is required because graphs are non-linear data structures.

---

## Termonology

**Vertex**: A node in a graph.

**Edge**: The connection between two nodes in a graph.

## Types & Use Cases

Graphs are used all over the place in computer programming and beyond! Some typical places you will see them include, but is not limited to:

- Social Networks
- Location / Mapping
- Routing Algos
- Visual Hierarchy
- File System Optimizations
- Databases

**Weighted vs. Unweighted**: A weighted graph's edges have value(s) associated with them while an unweighted has none.

**Directed vs. Undirected**: A directed graph has directions assigned between vertices while the undirected graph has data flow both directions between vertices.

## Type 1 Implementation

<!-- Directed vs Undirected -->

```js title=scripts/type1 lineNumbers=true highlight={1,6}
//  TSKGraph Class Declaration
class TSKGraph {
  constructor() {}
}

// Class Instantiation
```

---

## Type 2 Implementation

```js title=scripts/type2 lineNumbers=true highlight={1,6}
// TSKGraph Class Declaration
class TSKGraph {
  constructor() {}
}

// Class Instantiation
```

## Big O Analysis

**Access**: O()

**Insertion**: O()

**Deletion**: O()

**Searching**: O()
