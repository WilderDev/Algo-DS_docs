## The Basics

A graph is a collection of nodes and the connection between those nodes.
There is no specific pattern between nodes that is required because graphs are non-linear data structures.

---

###

---

## Termonology

**Vertex**: A node in a graph.

**Edge**: The connection between two nodes in a graph.

---

###

---

## Types & Use Cases

Graphs are used all over the place in computer programming and beyond! Some typical places you will see them include, but is not limited to:

- Social Networks
- Location / Mapping
- Routing Algos
- Visual Hierarchy
- File System Optimizations
- Databases

**Weighted vs. Unweighted**: A weighted graph's edges have value(s) associated with them while an unweighted has none.

**Directed vs. Undirected**: A directed graph has directions assigned between vertices while the undirected graph has data flow both directions between vertices.

## Type 1 Implementation

<!-- Directed vs Undirected -->

```js title=scripts/undirected-adjacency-list-graph lineNumbers=true
//  Undirected Class Declaration
class UndirectedGraph {
  constructor() {
    this.adjList = {};
  }

  // METHOD to add a vertex
  addVertex(vtx) {
    if (!this.adjList[vtx]) this.adjList[vtx] = [];
  }

  // METHOD to add an edge
  addEdge(v1, v2) {
    if (this.adjList[v1] && this.adjList[v2]) {
      this.adjList[v1].push(v2);
      this.adjList[v2].push(v1);
    }
  }

  // METHOD to remove an edge
  removeEdge(v1, v2) {
    if (this.adjList[v1] && this.adjList[v2]) {
      this.adjList[v1] = this.adjList[v1].filter((v) => v !== v2);
      this.adjList[v2] = this.adjList[v2].filter((v) => v !== v1);
    }
  }

  // METHOD to remove a vertex
  removeVertex(vtx) {
    if (!this.adjList[vtx]) return null;

    for (let adj of this.adjList[vtx]) {
      removeEdge(vtx, adj);
    }

    delete this.adjList[vtx];
  }
}

// Class Instantiation
```

---

## Type 2 Implementation

```js title=scripts/type2 lineNumbers=true highlight={1,6}
// TSKGraph Class Declaration
class TSKGraph {
  constructor() {}
}

// Class Instantiation
```

## Big O Analysis

**Access**: O()

**Insertion**: O()

**Deletion**: O()

**Searching**: O()
