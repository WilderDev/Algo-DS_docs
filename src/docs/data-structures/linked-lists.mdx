## The Basics

A Linked List is a linear data structure where each element, or node, has a pointer to another node.
Elements in a linked list are not indexed because they are not stored in memory together.

## Types & Use Cases

You will want to use a linked list for efficient insertion and deletion of a sequence. Linked lists are also used to
create constant time stacks and queues.

**Singly Linked List**: Each node has a pointer to the next. The last node points to null.

**Doubly Linked List**: Each node has a next & prev pointer.

**Circular Linked List**: Each node has a next node and the last node points back to the first/head.

## Singly Linked List Implementation

```js title=scripts/singly-linked-list lineNumbers=true highlight={1,9,18}
// Node Class Declaration
class Node {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

// Singly Linked List Class Declaration
class SinglyLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }
}

// Class Instantiation
const mySLL = new SinglyLinkedList();

mySLL.push("First");
mySLL.push("Second");
mySLL.push("Third");
```

## Doubly Linked List Implementation

```js title=scripts/doubly-linked-list lineNumbers=true highlight={1,10}
// Doubly Linked List Class Declaration
class DoublyLinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
    this.tail = null;
    this.length = 0;
  }
}

// Class Instantiation
```

## Big O Analysis

#### Singly Linked Lists

**Access**: O(n)

**Insertion**: O(1)

**Deletion**: O(1) / O(n)

**Searching**: O(n)

---

#### Doubly Linked Lists

**Access**: O(n)

**Insertion**: O(1)

**Deletion**: O(1)

**Searching**: O(n)

#### Advantages

- Dynamic Sizing
- Efficient Insertion & Deletion (Array insertion/deletion from front is very expensive)

#### Drawbacks

- Extra memory is needed for pointers
- Lack of caching ability
- Random access via index is not possible.
