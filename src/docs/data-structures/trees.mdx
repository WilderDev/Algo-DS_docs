## The Basics

A tree, in computer science, is a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship with one root node and no edges between siblings.

## Termonology

**Root**: The starting node in the tree with no parent elements nor siblings.

**Child**: A node that has a parent that points to it on a level lower in the tree.

**Parent**: a node that has child nodes it points to on a higher level.

**Sibling**: Nodes on the same level of a tree.

**Edge**: Nodes that are connected by a pointer.

**Leaf**: Nodes with no children at the highest level of the tree.

**Heap**: The two most common heaps are the min heap & the max heap. The max heap has the highest value at the root and every parent must be larger than it's children. The min has the smallest at the root and every parent must be smaller than it's children.

## Types & Use Cases

There are a lot of trees in computer science! We are focusing on a very select few that come up often.

**Binary Search Tree**: A tree structure where the left subtree of all nodes is less than it and all children on the right subtree are greater than that node.

We will create methods for breadth-first-search and 3 versions of depth-first-search using our binary tree!

**Min/Max Heap**: Binary Heaps such as Min Heap & Max Heap are useful in themselves but are mainly used to implement [Priority Queues](/data-structures/stacks-and-queues#priority-queue-implementation)

## Binary Search Tree Implementation

```js title=scripts/binary-search-tree lineNumbers=true
//  Binary Search Tree Class Declaration
class TSK {
  constructor() {}
}

// BST Class Instantiation
```

---

## Max Heap Implementation

> Min Heap is the same logic but change a few greater than `>` to less than symbols `<`

```js title=scripts/max-heap lineNumbers=true
// Max Heap Class Declaration
class TSK {
  constructor() {}
}

// Max Heap Class Instantiation
```
