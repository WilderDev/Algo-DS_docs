## Binary Search Tree Implementation

<!-- Directed vs Undirected -->

```js title=scripts/type1 lineNumbers=true highlight={1,6}
//  TSK Class Declaration
class TSK {
  constructor() {}
}

// Class Instantiation
```

---

## Type 2 Implementation

```js title=scripts/type2 lineNumbers=true highlight={1,6}
// TSK Class Declaration
class TSK {
  constructor() {}
}

// Class Instantiation
```
